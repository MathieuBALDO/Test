# Test
First commit in init brach

But I also commit on the head


Branch done after first commit on the head
We will test the merge

I edit my file in notepad on the branch I created from Windows GitHub

It seems
I commited only locally, so I do a second one.
I want to see what I will see when I will push on github.


Modify on branch which has benn not pushed

I do the merge and add the line in the middle
I can't eidt the master, so I created a Temp branch. Willc ommit then merge


I modified the master but didn't merge on the branch Test2 and I will do a second commit
